<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Install Explan directly from the VS Code Marketplace:
<p>
<blockquote>
    <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Explan-org.explan">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Explan-org.explan</a>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    Or search for ‘Explan’ in the extensions panel within VS Code (Ctrl + Shift
    + X).
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
    <img src="images/media/image24.png" />
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Once installed, choose one of the two ways of creating an Explan
    file:</p>

<p>
    1. Create a file with the extension of <code>.explan</code>, <code>.explan.json</code>, or
    <code>.explan.png</code> and open it using VS Code
</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>
    2. Run the Explan: Create new Explan Document action via the command
    palette (Ctrl + Shift + P)
    <img src="images/media/image30.png" />
</p>

<p>Either way, VS Code start up an empty Explan file with an interface that
    looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image45.png" style="width:6.4375in;height:4in" /></p>

<p>
    Press <code>Shift-Ctrl-H</code> to display all the keyboard shortcuts.

<h3 id="panel-navigation">Panel navigation:</h3>
<p><img src="images/media/image38.png" style="width:4.93229in;height:2.97517in" /></p>
<p>Use the navigation buttons in the top-right to switch between the
    “Task,” “Project,” “Simulation,” and “Config” panels.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image25.png" style="width:5.17188in;height:2.95009in" /></p>
<p>The right-hand panels can be resized by dragging on the left side
    notch of the panel.</p>
<h3 id="task-navigation">Task navigation:</h3>
<h4 id="task-area">Task area</h4>
<p><img src="images/media/image48.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.48611in" /></p>
<p>Click on a task on the left-hand side to “select” it. The details
    will appear in the Task tab if it is open.</p>
<p>Double clicking on a task will “Zoom” into it. In the zoomed mode,
    only the selected task and its immediate successors and predecessors
    will be displayed. Additionally, in the zoomed mode, single clicks on
    other tasks will move the “Zoom” focus onto that task. To exit the
    “Zoom” view and return to the full project view, double click on empty
    space around the tasks.</p>
<!-- <p>[gif of zoom navigation]</p> -->
<p>Keyboard shortcuts can also be used to navigate between zoomed in
    tasks.</p>
<!-- <p>[task keyboard nav labelled screenshot]</p> -->
<h4 id="radar">Radar</h4>
<p><img src="images/media/image4.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.875in" /></p>
<p>The radar shows a visual summary of the entire project. Clicking and
    dragging the mouse on the radar will change the task display to show
    only the radar selected portion of the project.</p>
<!-- <p>[gif of selecting?]</p> -->
<p>The radar view can be toggled on and off using the “Show radar”
    checkbox at the top of the screen.</p>
<h4 id="fuzzy-search">Fuzzy Search</h4>
<p><img src="images/media/image22.png" style="width:3.60417in;height:3.55208in" /></p>
<p>Using <strong>Ctrl-F</strong> will bring up a searchable list of all
    tasks in the project. The search is a fast fuzzy search, meaning that it
    will identify partial matches as well as full matches.</p>
<p>Navigate the search results using the up, down, and enter keys. The
    currently selected result is indicated by a line that is highlighted in
    blue. To enter a zoomed view of the selected result, press
    Ctrl-Enter.</p>
<h2 id="task-panel">Task Panel</h2>
<p>A task can be edited by clicking the task name on the left-hand
    panel. This will select the task and display all task details on the
    right-hand panel, also known as the “Task” tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image9.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.45833in" /></p>
<p>Within the Task tab, you are able to view and manipulate all of the
    selected task’s properties, as well as access 4 quick shortcuts.</p>
<p><img class=inline src="images/media/image19.png" style="width:1.63542in;height:0.40625in" /></p>

    project</p>
<p><img class=inline src="images/media/image23.png" style="width:0.32292in;height:0.33333in" /> : Duplicate the selected
    task. The duplicate will have the same predecessors and successors as
    the original task.</p>
<p><img class=inline src="images/media/image2.png" style="width:0.38542in;height:0.27083in" /> : Split a task into two
    tasks of equal halves. The resulting two tasks will both be half the
    duration of the original. The second half will be a successor of the
    first task.</p>
<p><img class=inline src="images/media/image6.png" style="width:0.30208in;height:0.3125in" /> : Delete the selected
    task.</p>

        A task with 0 duration, known as a <strong>milestone</strong>, is
        represented with a triangle
    </li>
    <li>
        A vertical, red dotted line in the task area indicates today’s
        date

<p>Toggle the “Only show critical paths” option to only view critical
    paths.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image43.png" /></p>

<h3 id="catchup">Catch up</h3>
<p>In Explan, the term "Catch Up" means to bring task completion % up to
    the red dotted line. The line denotes where task completion should be
    for that date to be "on time."</p>
<p>There are two buttons that can be used to “Catch Up” tasks with two
    different use cases.</p>
<p>The <img src="images/media/image37.png" style="width:0.92296in;height:0.32021in" /> button <strong>at the
        top</strong> of Explan will catch up <strong>all</strong> task
    progress -- including those that are not yet started, up to the
    percentage they should be at for today's date, as denoted by the red
    bar.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/media/image35.png" style="width:5.82508in;height:2.92188in" /></p>
<p><strong>After:</strong></p>
<p>Note how the "Other" and "Critical Path Path 1" tasks are updated.</p>
<p>Also note how the % completion of "Started 80%" task isn't reduced.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image32.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.13889in" /></p>
<p>The <img src="images/media/image29.png" style="width:0.78234in;height:0.34375in" /> button found within
    <strong>individual task details</strong> can be used to catch up the
    selected task individually.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/media/image31.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.16667in" /></p>
<p><strong>After:</strong></p>
<h3 id="section-1"><img src="images/media/image18.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.36111in" /></h3>
<h3 id="group-by">Group by</h3>
<p>Use the “Group by” dropdown to group your tasks based on a selected
    resource.</p>
<p>For example, tasks can be grouped by uncertainty.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image41.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.75in" /></p>
<h2 id="project-panel">Project Panel</h2>

<img src="./images/ProjectTag.png">

<h3 id="plan-status">Plan Status:</h3>
<p>The “Started” checkbox indicates whether or not the project has begun or not.
    A field is available to enter a project start date. Based on the project start
    date entered, a red line, the "today" marker, may appear on the task view.</p>
<h3 id="resources-metric-customization">Resources &amp; metric

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>To add custom resources, use the right-hand panel navigation to click
    on the “Project” tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image13.png" style="width:2.01563in;height:0.36515in" /></p>
<p>Add a new <strong>resource</strong> by clicking the <img src="images/media/image42.png"
        style="width:0.31036in;height:0.29522in" /> icon under the
    “<strong><u>Resources</u></strong>” section.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image3.png" style="width:2.21354in;height:1.3853in" /></p>
<p>Type in the name of a resource and hit “OK.”</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image34.png" style="width:1.6571in;height:1.12387in" /></p>
<p>The new resource will show up at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image44.png" style="width:2.11979in;height:1.6575in" /></p>
<p>Add values to a resource by clicking the pencil icon to the right of
    the resource. The first value listed in the resource is used as the
    default value for every new task created.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image7.png" style="width:2.18229in;height:1.35915in" /></p>
<p>In the above image, “Andy” will be the default “Person” value for all
    new tasks created.</p>
<p>Use the <img src="images/media/image46.png" style="width:1.58065in;height:0.3108in" /> buttons to reorder the
    values.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image12.png" style="width:0.3125in;height:0.27083in" />: Move value up one row</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image20.png" style="width:0.34375in;height:0.32292in" />: Move value down one row</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image11.png" style="width:0.32292in;height:0.33333in" />: Move value to the top
    row</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image15.png" style="width:0.34375in;height:0.29167in" />: Move value to the bottom
    row</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: For a “Person” resource, the first value could
    be entered as “Unassigned.” This way, all new tasks will have the value
    “Person: Unassigned.” This reflects practical use and the person
    resource can be assigned per task as you go.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image27.png" style="width:2.99479in;height:1.69905in" /></p>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<p>To add custom resources, use the right-hand panel navigation to click
    on the “Project” tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image13.png" style="width:2.01563in;height:0.36515in" /></p>
<p>Add a new <strong>metric</strong> by clicking the <img src="images/media/image42.png"
        style="width:0.31036in;height:0.29522in" /> icon under the
    “<strong><u>Metrics</u></strong>” section.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image36.png" style="width:2.13021in;height:1.26074in" /></p>
<p>Type in the name of a metric and hit “OK.”</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image26.png" style="width:1.45404in;height:1.03258in" /></p>
<p>The new metric will show up at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image8.png" style="width:3.17188in;height:1.98474in" /></p>
<p>The precision, as well as the range of the values in a
    <strong>metric</strong> can be edited by clicking the pencil icon to the
    right of the resource.
</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image33.png" style="width:2.47396in;height:1.87239in" /></p>
<h2 id="simulation-panel">Simulation Panel</h2>
<p>The “Simulate” button simulates the entire project 100 times based on
    entered task durations and uncertainty levels. Clicking the “Simulate”
    button returns various statistics from the simulations.</p>
<h3 id="critical-path">Critical Path</h3>
<p><img src="images/media/image10.png" style="width:4.16667in;height:1.1875in" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Critical Path</strong> section lists various changes to
    the critical path that happened in the simulation, along with the count
    of how many times the specific change happened.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Tasks listed in red denoted with a “-” symbol disappeared from the
        critical path in that specific iteration
    </li>
    <li>
        Tasks listed in green denoted with a “+” symbol were added to the
        critical path in that specific iteration
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This data can be used to get a better understanding of what tasks
    might be statistically important to port more resources to based on the
    frequency it shows up on the critical path.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image47.png" style="width:2.41667in;height:2.5625in" /></p>
<p>The duration/frequency section lists out all tasks in the
    project.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The duration column lists each task’s user-set duration.
        The duration units are based on the user selected units in the
        “Project” tab.
    </li>
    <li>
        The frequency column displays how often the task actually took the
        duration entered by the user in the task details.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a task that was entered with a duration of one week and
    low uncertainty might have a high frequency of taking one week in the
    simulation.</p>
<p>Likewise, another one week task with high uncertainty might have a very
    low frequency of taking one week in the simulation due to the high
    uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="config-panel">Config Panel</h2>
<p><img src="images/media/image16.png" style="width:2.64063in;height:1.3765in" /></p>
<p>In the “Config” panel, you can edit the image export settings.</p>
<p>Editing the “<strong>Width</strong> (<strong>px</strong>)” setting
    will change what width of image will be generated upon saving the image
    as a PNG.</p>
<p>Toggling the “<strong>Transparent Background</strong>” option will
    remove the white background of the image when saved as a PNG.</p>
<h1 id="saving-your-explan">Saving your explan</h1>
<p>Explans can be saved in two main formats, <strong>JSON</strong>
    (*.explan, *.explan.json) and <strong>PNG</strong>
    (*.explan.png)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>View the sections below to learn how to change a file extension to
    switch between <strong>JSON</strong> and <strong>PNG.</strong></p>
<p>Note: The “Only show critical paths” toggleable option will not alter
    the appearance of how an explan appears in image form. The entire
    project will appear.</p>
<h3 id="vs-code-version">VS Code Version:</h3>
<p>Quick-save your file by pressing Ctrl-S in your VS Code window.</p>
<p>To save a file as a <strong>png</strong>, press Ctrl-Shift-S in your
    VS Code window. This is the keyboard shortcut for the “Save as…”
    function in VS Code. A dialog box should open, prompting users to enter
    a name and file extension.</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image17.png" style="width:6.5in;height:0.97222in" /><img src="images/media/image1.png"
        style="width:2.30208in;height:0.75in" /></p>
<p><img src="images/media/image40.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.01389in" /></p>
<p>Now, this file can be used as an image like any other .png file.
    Additionally, the file will still contain all of the plan data. Simply
    open up the .explan.png in VS Code, and the entire explan is editable
    with the explan extension.</p>
<p>The process to save in <strong>json</strong> format is the same.
    Simply replace the file extension with either “.explan” or
    “.explan.json”.</p>
